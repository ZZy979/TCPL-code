The best way to learn a programming
language is by writing programs.
Typically, the first program beginners
write is a program called "Hello World",
which simply prints "Hello World" to
your computer screen.

A short line.

This line exactly does not need to wrap.

And this line exactly needs to
wrap......

This is
a-very-very-very-very-very-very-very-lon
g-word

	White spaces at beginning are kept,
and those at line wrap are dropped.


So
many
spaces!
